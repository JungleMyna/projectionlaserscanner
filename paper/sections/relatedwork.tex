The David Laser Scanner \cite{winkelbach:2006} is a software package that allows generation of 3D models of objects using a handheld laser and a cheap camera. The software package although originally free, is now available at a high price point. In addition, it can only run on Windows since currently it is heavily dependent on the .NET framework. Our paper intends to provide a free alternative to the David Laser Scanner. It is written in standard C++ and is dependent on OpenCV and \ac{3DTK} toolkits \cite{3dtk:2012} making it a widely-available as a cross-platform solution.
