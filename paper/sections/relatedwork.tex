The David Laser Scanner \cite{winkelbach:2006} is a software package that
allows generation of 3D models of objects using a handheld laser and a camera.
The software package although originally free, is now available at a price of
299 Euro. In addition, it can only run on Windows since currently it is
dependent on the .NET framework. This paper provides a free alternative to the
David Laser Scanner. It is written in standard C++ and is based on OpenCV and
\ac{3DTK} toolkits \cite{3dtk:2012} making it a widely-available as a
cross-platform solution.
