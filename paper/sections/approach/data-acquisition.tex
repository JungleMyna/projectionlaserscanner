We use an inexpensive web camera to capture multiple runs of a hand-held
laser sweeping across the object as shown in Fig. \ref{figure:acquisition}.
Since the videos are stored in a raw format which cannot be directly processed
by OpenCV \cite{bradski:2008}, we use \texttt{mplayer} to extract individual
frames at the rate of 5 frames per second.

\begin{verbatim}
$ mplayer -demuxer rawvideo \
          -rawvideo fps=5:w=1600:h=1200:yuy2 \
          -vo pnm:ppm $FILE
\end{verbatim}

These frames are read into memory by calling the OpenCV routine
\texttt{cvLoadImage()} with a \texttt{CV\_LOAD\_IMAGE\_UNCHANGED} flag. The
routine allocates an image data structure and returns a pointer to a struct of
type \texttt{IplImage}
