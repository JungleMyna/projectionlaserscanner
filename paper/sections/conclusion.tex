The process of data acquisition, point cloud generation and scan registrations
are currently performed offline. A foreseeable future work item is to make it
real time to allow the results to be viewed as they are being processed. A
performance evaluation with a larger dataset and a study comparing the results
with the David Laser Scanner also needs to be done.

We presented our implementation of an archaeological system for 3D object
reconstruction using a hand-held laser line projector and a web camera.  This
work provides a free and cross-platform alternative to the David Laser
Scanner. It uses contact-free triangulation with self-calibration of the laser
plane to generate the 3D object surface points. The point clouds obtained from
each scan are registered using \ac{SLAM} from \ac{3DTK} and viewed using its
fast viewer.
