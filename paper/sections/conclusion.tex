The process of data acquisition, point cloud generation and scan registrations
are currently performed offline. A foreseeable future work item is to make it
real time to allow the results to be viewed as they are being processed. It
will allow the user to not only adjust the speed of laser sweep, but also get
immediate feedback on the frequency of swipes required to avoid any gaps in the
final 3D model. In addition to the implementation, a performance evaluation
with a larger dataset and a study comparing the results with the David Laser
Scanner also needs to be done.

We presented our implementation of a 3D object reconstruction system using a
hand-held laser line projector and a web camera.  This work provides a free,
open-source, and cross-platform alternative to the David Laser Scanner. It
uses contact-free triangulation with self-calibration of the laser plane to
generate the 3D object surface points. The point clouds obtained from each
scan are registered using \ac{SLAM} from \ac{3DTK} and viewed using its fast
viewer.
