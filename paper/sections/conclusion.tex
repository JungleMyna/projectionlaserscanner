We presented our implementation of an archaelogical system for 3D object
reconstruction using a hand-held laser line projector and a web camera.  This
work provides a free and cross-platform alternative to the David Laser
Scanner. It uses contact-free triangulation with self-calibration of the laser
plane to generate the 3D object surface points. The point clouds obtained from
each scan are registered using \ac{SLAM} from \ac{3DTK}. The process of data
acquisition, point cloud generation and scan registrations are performed
offline. A foreseeable future work item is to make it real time to allow the
results to be viewed as they are being processed.
